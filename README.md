# An Anaylsis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to use the Kickstarter dataset from this module to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Challenges
For me one challenge working in excel was being able to work with a large data set. Also, working with some of the tools giving to us during the module such as the formulas used to debug errors. However, the external resources and also google and youtube was very helpful in helping me getting a better understanding of how to use the different formulas. 

## Results

### Two conclusions about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:
* Theater outcomes were the most successful in the month of June. 
* Theater outcomes failed the most in the months of May and October.

### One conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals:
* The most successful kickstarter campaigns asking for $45,000 to $49,999.

## Summary of the limitations of the dataset, and a recommendation for additional tables or graphs.
* A table showing demographics, such as age group, can be useful to determine if age has to do with the number of donations.
* The data set doesnt display any information about were the donations are coming from. For example if this was a kickstarter in NY, some areas are more wealthy and more familiar with going to the theater and may be willing to make a large donation compared to an area that is less familiar and have a lower income.
